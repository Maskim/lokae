Ecalypse helps successful rentals in 60+countries run their business, including Harley Davidson, Thrifty, U-save. Good for cars, bikes, boats and more.

== Description ==

We are makers of car rental websites and software. Reputable companies like Harley Davidson, Veico, Thrifty, Budget and many many others use our software.  

This rental plugin lets you turn your WordPress website into a full fledged rental website- cars, bikes, motorbikes, boats and pretty much anything that you want to rent.

We want to be transparent with you. Publishing this plugin to Wordpress is our way of A) giving back to the community B) expanding our marketing reach. 

This is a showcase product. So, some features might be limited. To access the full feature plugin, you will need to download the version from wp.ecalypse.com. That version includes everything we have ever and will ever put in the plugin. 

Also, it lets us provide premium services. Yes, of course, we will do our best to work more with you and deliver you more services for which we believe is fair to get paid. Download updates when they are made available and play with the code.

When you want to work with us personally, please expect to pay for the time and support. This is how we make our living and it allows us to provide a quality service- a product, constant development, support team, etc.

Finally, our plugin can be integrated with any theme. Please contact us for the feasibility to connect it to your favorite theme of choice.

Below is a run down of the key functionality and useful links with access info to demos, etc.


= Multiple items per rental =
Ecalypse Rental Starter supports one or multiple items per rental. If you are a car rental company, you will probably want your clients to only rent one car in one check out. If you are a bicycle rental, very often you will want your clients to rent multiple bikes at once as people usually rent bikes in groups. Both are supported.

= Ecalypse Rental Extensions =
Over the 4 years working on this software, we have created a lot of add-ons to this software that you can buy. Let us know if you would like to build an add on yourself or if you have any questions about what they can do.

* **Aggregate pricing** -> lets you edit multiple pricing schemes on the fly and then quickly assign them to multiple cars as opposed to editing them one by one. A bit of a time saver if you have an operation that requires a lot of input.
* **Branch delivery plugin** -> you have more branches and want to set up different prices for pick up/delivery/transfer between them.
* **Back end calendar** -> lets you see visually, when cars are booked and their reservations.
* **Payment gateways** (for you to accept credit card payments online): Stripe, eWay, Mercadopago and many others.
* **Partner sales** -> lets you monitor sales of your sales partners (they insert their ID code when making a booking, and then you can  track how much sales they generate in any given period).
* **Client area login** (clients can create an account, view their booking history, save billing details, etc.).
* **Change footer info** (lets you change footer information).
* **Pdf generator plugin** -> lets you send reservation confirmation with attached pdf and clients can also save reservation pdf.
* **Change footer** -> lets you easily edit the footer of your website.
* **Custom inputs plugin** -> lets you add and remove custom fields to your reservation form, where clients insert their client info. You can also set them as mandatory.
* **Fixed dates plugin** -> lets you set up specific date ranges and give them a fixed price. E.g., I set up July-1st to July-7th for 150 dollars. Everybody who clicks within that range, will automatically get July-1 to 7 for $150.
